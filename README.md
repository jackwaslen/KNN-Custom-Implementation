KNN Investigation
In this project, I utilize pandas, matplotlib and sklearn to create a custom "k-nearest neighbours" classifier.
I split data into train and test data to enable me to validate the accuracy of my model.
I perform cross-validation using sklearn's cross validation tool, and graph the k-values relative to the accuracy score.
